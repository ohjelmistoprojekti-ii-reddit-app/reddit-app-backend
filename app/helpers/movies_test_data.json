You can actually see him go cold was my understanding. That also really pisses me off that the video was edited to make it seem otherwise and what this info must be doing to his family. Making this into a movie now would put it in the Lone Survivor category where we know from Marcus himself, that it was all BS and he ran after they were ambushed and that the navy wrote the book for him so they would have a hero rather than a disaster.

Mainly because at the time, I was into Star Trek: The Next Generation (Voyager and DS9 wasn't aired frequently in my area for some reason) and it felt like a slap in the face to have every show after The Original Series removed from continuity - basically very similar to Disney's removal of the Star Wars expanded universe into Legends.\n\nAfter having to sit through it in school, though, I found that I liked the music and gradually ended up liking the film, its awareness of what it was doing, the actors, references to the original show. I've 180'd on the film so much, I actually defended the way the Kelvinverse films handled Kirk in a discussion on Facebook a few months ago. The lessons I learned from that helped me grow a lot in terms of accepting reboots/remakes and cast changes.",

They gave up their lives to work for him. Does he think that kind of devotion is disgusting?\n\nThe dinner was mostly about getting back at the elite guests who he blames for losing his love of cooking. He became too focused on trying to cook unique dishes to impress people and not cooking what he loves. But it’s not all their fault. He’s just as culpable. He wouldn’t reach that high status if he didn’t want it to. He gives the guests shit food all night bc he knows he can bc they will pretend to love it bc he’s making it. So did he just decide everything is bullshit and want to burn it all down? \n\nSlowik wants to burn everything down, but I wonder if he’s trying to punish his kitchen staff in the process too. Do you think he holds some distain for the kitchen staff for feeding into the soul less of the elite? They give up everything to work with him. They don’t even have personalities much outside of him. Do you think he thinks his kitchen staff are part of the problem? They put him on such a high pedestal that they’d do anything to work for him, just like how the guests will pay any price for dinner with him. I know the kitchen staff makes fun of toxic work environments. But do you think Slowik wanted to kill them, not as part of the art, but bc he wanted to punish them?\n\nI know it’s probably the first one. This whole dinner was an art experiment. But I also like the theory of the dinner just a way to show how dumb everyone (even the staff is). He views his staff as “those who give,” those who sacrifice their lives for the elite so yeah it’s probably probably the first one. It just feels somewhat hypocritical for him to blame everyone but himself for how his life spiraled. I don’t remember him admitting that he played a role in his fate. But he could also he too petty to admit that. \n\n",

Like somehow I thought Doc Brown had made vehicles where all that had to happen was you went 88 mph and sparks would appear in front of you before you disappeared leaving behind a trail of fire. So I think I was genuinely anticipating that happening so I could feel smug that I was smart enough to guess what would happen next. \n\n  \nThe second was Jingle All the Way. Again, way too young, and it's a movie where Arnold Schwarzenegger does the whole 90s \"Dad who can't make time for the kids\" trope. So when Schwarzenegger's character achieves his goal and needs to pick his kid out from the crowd, I was worried he wouldn't be able to name his kid the winner because I worried he was such a neglectful father that he forgot his son's name.

          "I went ahead and watched this out of pure curiosity being Sally Field's only real directorial wide release and the cast. It was not great. I could appreciate what it was going for, but unlike other Beauty Pageant films from the time (Drop Dead Gorgeous, Miss Congeniality, Little Miss Sunshine, all confirmed bangers) this didn't feel like it had much respect for the competition or the competitors, frivolous as they may seem.\n\nMinnie and Joey are playing women in their early 20s but Minnie especially always reads older to me. She just has that look about her. Joey Lauren Adams is good to see here, someone I wish I saw more in movies, but her plotline is wild. She gets thrown in jail because a patient at the elderly home she works at scams her out of pills and dies of an overdose. And that seems like a much more interesting movie to me than the beauty pageant, but it's really just used as a plot mechanic to pair Minnie Driver up with Hallie Eisenberg (the Pepsi girl from the late 90's, fun fact, also Jesse Eisenberg's sister.)\n\nThe main thesis here is that Minnie Driver has a child but her best friend and roommate Joey Lauren Adams raises it for her as her own because you can't have children and compete in beauty pageants. I honestly didn't even know that before the movie, and after watching it I don't really feel like it's worth all the hubbub. Minnie isn't depicted as wanting to be Miss America for any altruistic reason, it's constantly implied that her skewed view of beauty is leftover trauma from her terrible upbringing and her inability to be a mother is the same. So this movie is Minnie learning to claim her own child and give up her dreams, but it also plays as a movie that argues mothers should be allowed to compete. I feel like it needed to pick one. \n\nAnyways, pretty clear to see why this didn't hit. It's tonally all over the place. Is it a mother/daughter drama? A pageant comedy? A best friend dramedy? Depends on the scene. 4/10."

The use of Chicago Fire and Police Departments with their naval and mounted units were genuinely there.  It was the first major film to incorporate both state and multiple municipal assets in the making of a film in Illinois, this does not happen.  Even today to get all these agencies to work together in this capacity would require not only the cooperation of both the governor, secretary of state, multiple mayors and county officials but also a good deal state staff to allow being involved in looking foolish.  This on top of driving through downtown at dangerous top speeds and filming in areas like Maxwell Street before gentrification, having both the bands and the other top talents on screen who for many was their first time.  Then there’s the behind the scenes legends, many of which have been documented.\n\nIt may not seem like it but this crazy movie is a fascinating time capsule, lightning in a bottle that sadly won’t ever happen again.

          "That's...not the impression one gets reading the piece. Literally right off of the bat:\n\n\u003ESome of my experiences of seeing him work were as a kid, and at that point, **he would have a bit more of a divide when he would come home because it would be confusing for a five-year-old. This was maybe the most I had seen him really staying in character** on- and off-set in all the times I’ve seen him work, and it was pretty amazing to see it from that different vantage point. **It was mainly to do with his voice and manner of speech and phrasing of things. It’s kind of a strange double thing because it’s still him**, but it’s almost like two people superimposed over each other at times when we weren’t on set and dialed into that world.\n\nI always suspected the situation wasn't QUITE as extreme as it's sometimes depicted as being: probably everyone by now know the B-roll of [Day-Lewis breaking character](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjNw3pNsSmM) on the set of *There Will Be Blood*. I know other method or quasi-method actors also aren't really like what Day-Lewis is proported to being: I think I once heard it said that method actors like Viggo Mortensen \"stay in the vicinity of the character\" rather than actually BEING that person 24/7.\n\nI'm also always left a little puzzled by the entire approach, simply because if the intent is to get away from affectation and make it natural and spontaneous...well, many of Day-Lewis' most acclaimed performances are in their own way quite showy and theatrical: think about There Will Be Blood. It's brilliant, but his method is not doing what's it's \"supposed\" to be doing.",
          "Hold on this is the first of me hearing this kinda thing. Like I've heard of Viggo being all dirty and wearing his costume and sleeping in his trailer to stay in character during LOTR when he's supposed to be filthy and miserable. But are you telling me when Lewis filmed Gangs of New York he went home to his family and actually acted like a blood thirsty psycho around his family?"

And their warped version of christmas- turning something wholesome into something horrifying (even if it still gets a happy ending) is a good formula for a spooky fun halloween movie. Setting and characters weigh just as much as plot for this film, so it is equally both halloween and christmas, and therefore the compromise would be to watch for thanksgiving.",

He doesn't feel right. He then stumbles upon Christmas town and believes he has purpose again. When his stint as Santa fails, he finally realizes and embraces who he is.",
          "It technically takes place on Halloween too, albeit for only the opening sequence...\n\nI'm on your side though.. It's both holidays, but it's a Christmas movie... Through and through. \n\nAfter the opening sequence and first night, the only thing connected to Halloween is it's characters, but the holiday itself is over. It's then about those characters discovering and eventually learning the true spirit of Christmas. \n\nI honestly don't enjoy watching it on Halloween because of that. Sure, the characters look the part, but the story, themes, and end result are all *Christmas.*",
          "It's both, maybe ...... Burton had the idea to combine Halloween and Christmas but the movie's director, Henry Selick, states that it's a Christmas movie:\n\n*“Tim’s idea to combine Halloween with Christmas — where, unlike the miserable Grinch, a well-intentioned Jack Skellington takes over the Christmas holiday — is pure genius. Thirty years after I directed the film, beneath its candy corn coating, skeletons and vampires, corpse child and witches, I know ‘Nightmare’ at its heart is a Christmas movie,” he said.*\n\nhttps://nypost.com/2024/10/28/entertainment/the-nightmare-before-christmas-is-not-a-halloween-movie-director/",
          "Water is also wet. 🤷‍♂️😄\n\nI know Halloween is a big part of it, but it’s literally about a demon that’s so sick of spooktober, that he schemes about appropriating Christmas."

While Christmas is about peace, joy, community, generosity, goodwill, gift giving, reflections of the past, winter solstice, renewal/evergreen.\n\nI think one major point that solidifies it for me is that, in the end, Jack finally realizes the true meaning of Christmas and performs an act of generosity and kindness in order to save Santa Claus. Which, generosity and kindness are a Christmas theme, not Halloween.\n\nSo, yes, there are some Halloween themes like identity and fear of the unknown. But the majority of the themes, plot, and moral of the story are Christmas related. So, at best, I think it's a Christmas movie with some Halloween elements.\n\nBut I'm interested in the community's arguments for or against. Happy October, y'all! 🎃🎄",

          "Always on the list for the greatest car chases of all time.\n\nIt was such an instantly recognized iconic classic scene, that Frankenheimer's sequel, **French Connection II**, knew it would be a mistake to try to top it.  So, instead, it offered an intense *foot chase* as the film's climax --also one of the greatest of all time.",
          "https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_French_Connection_(film)\n\n\u003EThe film is often cited as featuring one of the greatest car chase sequences in movie history. The chase involves Popeye commandeering a civilian's car (a 1971 Pontiac LeMans) and frantically chasing an elevated train on which a hitman is trying to escape. The scene, coordinated by Bill Hickman, was filmed in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, roughly running under the BMT West End Line (now the D, ​R, and ​W trains, then the B train), which runs on an elevated track above Stillwell Avenue, 86th Street, and New Utrecht Avenue in Brooklyn, with the chase ending just north of the 62nd Street station. At that point, the train hits a train stop but is going too fast to stop in time and collides with the train ahead of it, which has just left the station.\n\n\u003EThe scene's most famous shot is from a front bumper mount and shows the streets from a low angle. Director of photography Owen Roizman wrote in American Cinematographer magazine in 1972 that the camera was undercranked to 18 frames per second to enhance the sense of speed; this effect can be seen on a car at a red light whose exhaust pipe is pumping smoke at an accelerated rate. Other shots involved stunt drivers who were supposed to barely miss Doyle's car, but due to errors in timing, accidental collisions occurred that were left in the film. Friedkin said he used Santana's cover of Peter Green's song \"Black Magic Woman\" during editing to help shape the chase sequence. The song does not appear in the film, but the chase scene \"did have a sort of pre-ordained rhythm to it that came from the music\".\n\n\nRumored they did not have permits to film this scene.",

It's about a dream getaway that spirals into a nightmare of sex, lies, manipulation, and a fight for survival. Ask me anything!\n\n**Synopsis:**\n\nA couple's vacation at a secluded estate is upended when they're forced to share the mansion with a mysterious couple. A dream getaway spirals into a nightmarish maze of sex, lies, and manipulation, triggering a battle for survival.\n\n**Trailer:**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQy7BuW-R6c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQy7BuW-R6c)\n\nIt stars Maddie Hasson, Marco Pigossi, Alex Roe, Andra Nechita, Clayton Spencer, and Eliane Reis. It's in theaters nationwide October 3, 2025\n\n**More information:**\n\n* Rating - R\n* Runtime - 94 Minutes\n* Official Selection of Fantastic Fest 2024\n\n**Director's Statement:**\n\n\u003EWhen I first came on to direct \"Bone Lake\", the initial allure for me was its duality; on one hand, it offers the thrill and escapism that's characteristic of a \"popcorn movie\", and on the other, it champions an underrepresented narrative about modern relationships. Delving deeper, this film dances on the line of our complex cinematic cravings: we're drawn to the intoxicating pull of gratuitous sex and visceral violence, yet we simultaneously yearn for a tale anchored in emotions, trust, and genuine partnership. The film doesn't trumpet its progressiveness, but for the discerning eye, there are subtle nuances in the portrayal of gender roles and relationships. Like a serene lake that hides unexpected depths beneath its calm surface, \"Bone Lake\" takes a joyful, entertaining veneer and uses it to navigate the fluidity of gender, and the paradox of our desires. I wanted this film not just to entertain, but to resonate – to serve as both a mirror and a beacon for the way relationships can and are being redefined in our time. Through its thrilling narrative highs and emotional troughs, \"Bone Lake\" bridges the gap between the familiar and the groundbreaking, inviting audiences to revel in its excitement and reflect on its profound implications.\n\nAsk me anything! I'll be back later today Wednesday 10/1 at 3 PM ET to answer your questions.",

          "Best sports movie ever made, hands down.",
          "Still so good. A perfect distillation of what Disney used to do so well and that they've basically abandoned now. This movie could have easily been one note, but the way they escalate the racism stakes from the team to the parents to the townspeople to the institutions keeps it very watchable even if the structure is basically comedy beat - emotional beat - team losing - switch up strat - team winning. The pacing is pretty impressive. 45 minutes at Football camp, then it covers an entire Football season and zooms in on four or five games without feeling too repetitive. \n\nDenzel is immaculate in this. For someone who has basically never turned in a bad performance, this is exactly the kind of mid-tier stuff he was made to elevate to Godly levels. This might be his most iconic performance to me, obviously he has more important and better performances like Philadelphia and Malcolm X, but you can show Remember the Titans to a 10 year old and they'd understand the power of Denzel. He’s funny, committed, and he commands this entire movie in such a powerful way. Will Patton is also a bit of glue for this movie, he has a great arc where he has the most to lose by Boone staying head coach and he’s really not fully “in” on Boone until that game where the refs are making unfair calls. But the setup to the moment where he decides is him being present in all of the previous scenes, seeing what Boone does for these kids and his conviction. Also Coach Yoast is such a great name. \n\nThere are also, like, eight other smaller performances in this that are incredible from the players to the parents. Bertiere's mom has, like, two minutes of screen time and is amazing? Her line reading of, “I don’t *want* to get to know him!” has stuck with me all these years and despite having basically no more lines still has two great scenes. There’s just so much room for everyone to contribute in this. I didn’t even realize Avon Barksdale was in this even though I had seen this movie five times before I had ever even heard of The Wire. Ethan Suplee has maybe never been so perfectly cast as this. Even child Hayden Panettiere is fantastic in this and has a ton of scenes with a range of emotions. Really, really well cast film and it’s probably its greatest strength. \n\nThis is a classic for me and rewatching it was still as good as it used to be. Enough needle drops to break a stereo but a great soundtrack of half Southern Creedence and half The Temptations. It’s certainly not some heavy rumination on racism, but Shane Gillis was right when he said it’s about how important Football is in America, that only the high school team going 4-0 in Alabama could defeat racism. 9/10.",

Now you might argue that she was not to blame for following the guidance of the photos, after all they all did the same, but predetermination or no it was clear that she was motivated by her desire to recapture the love & attention of Finn.\n\nFinn, hearing all of this and also learning about her infidelity prior to discovering the camera, rejects Callie and intends to destroy the camera and leave.\n\nAnd this brings us to the bitter irony...\n\nHad Callie accepted Finns decision and allowed him to leave her, Finn would likely have lived. But Callie couldn't let him go. In the ultimate act of desperation she attempted to reset the day and prevent him from learning the truth so she could live on in the lie.\n\nIt was her choice to deny Finn his free will ultimately led to her losing him forever...\n\nI'll have to pop this one on the keepers list so I don't forget about it again as it was solid movie that I never hear people talking about.",

          "When Eleanor arrives for her Bat Mitzvah, its implied that Roger brought some sort of top-secret super-special guests that would be a huge surprise to Eleanor. Then the Bat Mitzvah happens and there arent really any crazy surprise guests. They show that her friends from the support group are there, and I assume that was who the surprise guests were supposed to be, but I guess I didnt see the big deal. Initially I assumed maybe Roger tracked down the brother or other estranged members of the holocaust family and that was who the surprise was going to be. The mega shocking surprise being members of the support group sort of fell flat for me. Anyone else?",
          "The thing with Eleanor is that she should have confessed at the meeting the first time. She could have simply said that she had a story to tell on Bess' behalf. If I were Nina, the idea of a decades old friendship between an American convert and a Holocaust survivor would have been catnip for me as a writer. The difference between the worlds. How does a Christian turn Jewish women who converted when she was a full grown adult see Judaism compared to one who was born into it and the entire culture. What is the difference between being Jewish in American and Jewish in Poland?\n\nI was surprised that Squibb is actually 94 years old in real life. When Eleanor stated this in the movie I thought this was a case of a younger actress playing an older role. But, nope, she was 94 when she filmed this. I thought she was twenty years younger. I hope I have the same energy if I get to be that age. She was so feisty. As much as I didn't agree with what she did, I had to admire her spunkiness.",
          "A fun and heartfelt time, even if it’s disjointed. It’s very sweet and Squibb as always is incredible",
          "\"Shark Tale but Holocaust\" directed by the Mermaid Princess from The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie.\n\nNot on my bingo card tbh.",
          "This movie was really surprised. I had no idea what it was about so when it started getting into the Holocaust I was honestly a little shocked. I can’t say the movie didn’t get to me, though. I saw it in the morning in a theater full of older women and I’d be lying if I said we weren’t all in tears most of the time. \n\nJune is just such fun to watch be a bit cranky and this plays that up very well. The fact that she’s still giving performances like this is very cool and this really asks a lot of her comedically and dramatically. It’s really by the sheer force of her performance that this plot works at all. Have to shoutout Erin Kellyman too, she’s really good in this and I hope to continue to see her around. \n\nThis is a movie about grief and loss, and it’s not very subtle about it. Either that will work for you or it won’t. The climax of the movie is Chiwetel Ejiofore basically lecturing the world on how we talk about (or don’t talk enough about, really) our grief and how it makes us feel. It connected with me but this whole movie has this cheesy gloss over it that I can see a lot of people rubbing up against. It’s a classic tale of a lie getting bigger and bigger until it breaks very publicly and the main character with good intentions is exposed to have done some bad things, so it’s fairly predictable in that sense. \n\nOverall, a very interesting choice for Scarlett’s first directorial feature. Pretty common to not want to muddy your own waters by starring in your movie when your star power is as big as hers, but a lot of this movie really worked for me so good for her. It was clear she wasn’t interested in making something easy or obvious, I feel like most people would stay away from this subject and would want someone sexier than June starring in their first feature. I think all that is pretty cool. 7/10 for me, worth a good cry if you really need one.",
          "The actor for Bess takes the cake here. There could've been a better movie made. It feels extremely short for such an incredible premise. Someone, either the writer or Scarlet Johansson, needed a bit more courage to really make this great. As it stands, it's mostly premise with little good execution.",
          "How does it compare to Thelma? That was fantastic.",
          "There were moments where I could really see Scarlett's influence on Erin Kellyman's performance - which I find more interesting than anything negative. More curious if Scarlett saw something in herself and that's why she was hired or of she imparted something on the actress...in a cool way.\n\nCan't help but notice that even Scarlett Johansson can't even help but open with an alarm clock in her directorial debut. Some things are just irresistible."

      "From another article:\n\n[https://www.dutchnews.nl/2025/10/far-right-march-through-amsterdam-in-anti-immigration-protest/](https://www.dutchnews.nl/2025/10/far-right-march-through-amsterdam-in-anti-immigration-protest/)\n\n\u003EAround 1,000 far-right activists gathered on the Museumplein in Amsterdam on Sunday to protest about immigration and to ‚Äúdefend the Netherlands‚Äù.\n\n\u003E\\[...\\]\n\n\u003EOne group arriving under police escort carried a large banner with the words ‚Äúdefend Netherlands‚Äù in English, lighting orange smoke bombs as they arrived to cheers.\n\n\u003E\\[...\\]\n\n\u003EMeanwhile, some 400 people gathered on the Jonas Dani√´l Meijerplein, next to the Portuguese synagogue in the city centre, as a counter voice to the far-right protest. That stage had a banner proclaiming ‚Äúno more fascism‚Äù as a backdrop. The event on the Museumplein, one speaker said, was a ‚Äúfestival of hate‚Äù.",
      "The political situation is a bit of a mess in The Netherlands right now. Every other week there is a demonstration of the far left or far right. Sometimes even together at the same time. That leads to heated debates and the voice of reason to be droned out by the noise. \n\n\nYou see the same situation in upcoming elections. It is the left vs the right, like many countries. But they are all focussing on a non-issue topic if you ask me.\n\n\nLike many other countries, the Netherlands has a housing crisis. Buying a house as a new comer is unaffordable but there also aren't any renting alternatives. This is a real issue. However there are a lot of reasons this issue is created and it is not easy to solve in a country that is slowly getting overpopulated. \n\n\nThe discussion is then shifted towards immigration. \"They take up precious housing, they do not work, they don't pay tax and their children will be criminals a few years from now\" is what the most popular right-wing political party says. While the issues with immigration are real, they are inflated. The left ignore the issues altogether.\n\n\nIn my opinion, it is a problem with the way immigration is handled. Newcomers are not allowed to work until their asylum has been granted which can take several years. This alienates them from society, it drains money and it bores out asylum seekers. Which in the long run inflates the number of them getting into trouble with the police.\n\n\nBut nobody in the current elections looks at it this way. The populism wins once again, and the new government will fall within years because their populist views do not work in the real world. And so, the cycle continues. ",
      "75% of Jews living in the Netherlands at the start of WW2 were send to concentration camps to be murdered. [It took until 2020 for the government to acknowledge how fucked it was that they sent over 100,000 people to be tortured to death.](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-51258081)",
      "The slogans they shouted were absolutely disgusting.\n\nHowever, it were only 500 people. The pro Palestina protest, a week before that, had 250000 people.",
      "\u003EDuring the march, some demonstrators were chanting racist and antisemitic phrases, some targeted towards GroenLinks-PvdA leader Frans Timmermans.\n\n\u003E\\[...\\]\n\n\u003ENot only were some demonstrators carrying the *prinsenvlag*, a former Dutch flag with orange instead of red, that was once used by the far-right Dutch National Socialist Movement, but they were also chanting racist and antisemitic phrases. According to *Het Parool*, one group were even heard singing that Timmermans is a ‚Äúfilthy, dirty, cancer Jew‚Äù.\n\n\u003ETimmermans was also later verbally abused by a group of men while being interviewed at a cafe in Amsterdam before an election debate. One of the men called him a ‚Äúdirty dog‚Äù and gave a Nazi salute as he walked away. \n\n\"Legitimate concerns\"",

Got it. Confirmed by the Russians denying it.

      "At least 27 people have been killed in fierce clashes between Hamas security forces and armed members of the Dughmush family in Gaza City, in one of the most violent internal confrontations since the end of major Israeli operations in the enclave.\n\n\n\n\nMasked Hamas gunmen exchanged fire with clan fighters near the city's Jordanian hospital, witnesses said.\n\n\n\n\nA senior official in the Hamas-run interior ministry said security units surrounded them and engaged in heavy fighting to detain them. The ministry said eight its members were killed in \"an armed assault by a militia\".\n\nMedical sources said 19 Dughmush clan members and eight Hamas fighters had been killed since fighting began on Saturday.",
      "Everyone seems to forget the part of the story that says Hamas was trying to ‚Äúevict‚Äù the clan from a hospital so that they in turn could use it as a new base of operations‚Ä¶.A hospital‚Ä¶..more terrorists In hospitals which you guessed it makes it a legitimate military target.",
      "There are a lot of people here who don't understand shit about Gaza and its society. \n\nIf hamas (and for the simplicity  of the argument I'm talking about the footsoldiers/militants) disarms, all of them will be defenestrated within 24 hours. Their only 2 options are either stay armed and in power, or gtfo somewhere far away with insurances, and tbh I dont see what it looks like. This is not a situation where hamas gracefully surrenders with a nice speech by their general, like in that scene from 'band of brothers', get to a camp for a few months and then live peacefully ever after.\n\nThis is also not a case of 'the people rising against hamas tyranny'. This is a tribal warfare, where all the sides are very much alike. There will be no amnesty and no coexistance, until a clear winner emerges and the loser is reduced to nothing.\n\nJust like hamas did to fatah in 2007, just like they are are doing to doghmush clan now, it will be done to them. As soon as israel pulls out there will be an all out war between clans, and whoever will come on top will do so after they've killed all the rest, in the most medieval way possible. I'm taking about burnings, beheadings, tying the victims to a motorcicle and driving across town until there is nothing left to bury, like they did in 2007. And this will be done by whoever gets on top, be it hamas, Fatah, some ad hoc clan aliance to whoever loses.\n\nThere is no peaceful transfer of power in the middle east. ",

But to effect an operational/strategic change you need volume most of all.\n\nAn example I can give are the H.I.M.A.R.S Ukraine recieved only a couple at the start. With the help of these systems they achieved some tactical victories but Russia was able to learn and adapt.

Taiwan is a good candidate until you consider, because you want to diversify from the US, China unfortunately is one of our other major trade partners. Ultimately it doesn‚Äôt make sense to have an issue from both major partners if we can (there is already some limited contention with China and our EV tariffs, which potentially go away depending on how auto trade goes with the US) to grow a relationship with Taiwan at the moment. Probably the Canadian government is playing the waiting game and seeing where things go.

Since his return to power in 2018, he's done nothing to alleviate the desperate poverty his countrymen and -women experience on a daily basis. Instead of investing state funds in basic infrastructure like power generation capacity, consistent clean water delivery, educational reforms (the current primary school curriculum is the same as the French colonial one from 1960), he's spent money loaned to the state in vanity legacy building projects such as a new mall, a cable car system (that goes nowhere useful, costs half a day's wages to ride, and officially only runs for 6 hours a day, though often less due to power cuts), and modern luxury apartments built by regime-friendly businessmen that lie empty because no one can afford them.",

      "7 EU states increase Russian energy imports in 2025, Reuters reports\nOctober 10, 2025 7:57 pm\n\nSeven EU member states have increased their imports of Russian energy in 2025 compared with last year, even as the bloc seeks to diminish its reliance on Russian fossil fuels, Reuters reported on Oct. 10.\n\nIn the first eight months of 2025, the European Union imported over 11 billion euros ($12,7 billion) worth of Russian energy. That amount comes despite a 90% reduction in reliance on Russian supplies since 2022.  \n\nAmong the seven nations increasing their purchases, France saw a 40% year-on-year jump, importing 2.2 billion euros ($2.5 billion), while the Netherlands' imports surged 72% to 498 million euros ($579 million).\n\nBelgium, Croatia, Romania, and Portugal also raised their imports. Hungary recorded an 11% year-on-year increase.\n\nHungary and Slovakia have remained major recipients of Russian oil and gas, accounting for some 5 billion euros ($5.8 billion) of the bloc's energy bill.\n\nAccording to Reuters, Vaibhav Raghunandan, an EU-Russia specialist at the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), described the upward flows as \"a form of self-sabotage,\" noting that Russia's energy revenues remain its largest funding source in the war.  \n\nFrance's energy ministry told Reuters that the rise in the value of Russian energy imports this year reflected its role as a transit hub, supplying clients in other European states. Market data from Kpler suggests some of that gas is being forwarded onward to Germany.    \n\nThe Dutch government noted it supports EU phase-out plans, but until laws are in place, it cannot void existing contracts with Russian suppliers.\n\nMuch of the trade takes place via liquefied natural gas (LNG). That form of supply now represents nearly half the value of EU oil and gas purchases from Russia.\n\nMajor energy firms like TotalEnergies, Shell, and Gunvor continue to operate long-term contracts with Russian suppliers, some with durations stretching into the 2030s and 2040s.\n\nThe growing EU reliance on Russian energy has drawn sharp criticism from the United States. Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Sept. 23, U.S. President Donald Trump urged European nations to \"immediately cease all energy purchases from Russia,\" calling the continued imports \"inexcusable\" and accusing NATO allies of funding the very war they are opposing.\n\n\"Europe has to step it up. They can't be doing what they're doing. They're buying oil and gas from Russia while they're fighting Russia,\" Trump said, adding that China and India were also \"primary funders\" by continuing to purchase Russian oil.",

If you have 10K students all honestly writing an essay, and the software has a 1% false positive rate, you'll have 100 innocently accused students. Each of those cases will turn into a pile of paperwork, lawyers, and angry letters. Someone will commit suicide eventually.",
      "\u003EThe ABC has seen emails from ACU academic integrity officers requesting students provide handwritten and typed notes and internet search histories to rule out AI use.\n\nSubmit a search history filled with embarassing medical searches, I'd also follow up on their policies around how to handle this information.

In which case prepare to prove your innocence a lot, since AI tends to say a lot and is made to appease the person doing the prompting.\n\nTo prove their innocence, people had to provide something which can be forged or circumvented by opening an incognito tab. Which is the pinnacle of total technical incompetence and fear of being cheated rolled into one.",

      "with nato's lacking number of ground based air defenses, production needs to scale up a large amount, cause post cold war nato didn't feel they needed nearly as much of that. Also costs need to come down or a cheaper thing needs to be developed in short order for stuff like shaheds just for scale....and ukraine has a LOT of airspace to defend..I think the only nation with a robust ground based air defense system against mass drone attacks is israel really, but even if they went with that it would still need it's production to scale up a lot because of ukraine having a lot more area to cover..if israel and the american companies working with them on it were even willing to export it to ukraine.",

      "The issue of achieving peace between Kyiv and Moscow remains profoundly complex. From my understanding, for Ukraine to contemplate any peace agreement, Russia would need to fully withdraw its forces and relinquish control of Crimea. This stance is hardly surprising. Crimea holds immense strategic and symbolic value, and it is inconceivable that Ukraine would acquiesce to continued Russian occupation of the peninsula. For Russia to consider returning all territories it has seized in Ukraine, its economy would likely need to suffer a catastrophic collapse, potentially triggering internal unrest among the populace, oligarchs, or military establishment, or even leading to the ousting of President Putin. Such a scenario could plausibly unfold if Russia‚Äôs economy sustains further severe damage, particularly in its energy sector, which, as is widely recognised, constitutes the country‚Äôs primary economic output. However, such an outcome would likely require considerable time, almost certainly extending well beyond a year.",

      "\u003EIshiba noted that the Keisuke Okada Cabinet at the time ‚Äúyielded to military demands and rejected the previously mainstream Emperor organ theory,‚Äù stating that ‚Äúthe government lost control over the military.‚Äù\n\n\nThat's why the war had all those atrocities. Not why it started in the first place. \n\n\nEast Asian Co Prosperity Sphere. That was the political plan. Bind East Asia together by force with Japan as the leader. ",
      "\u003EOutgoing Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on Oct. 10 released a statement of personal reflections to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II by posing a tantalizing question: ‚ÄúWhy couldn‚Äôt Japan avoid that war?‚Äù\n\nBecause they didn't even try?\n\nI kid. The article makes the talk sound much more thoughtful than the headline suggests. I almost respect Ishiba a little bit more from it. He's clearly no intellectual lightweight. That said, it's no surprise his term as PM excited exactly zero people:\n\n\u003EBased on this analysis, the prime minister summarized the ‚Äúlessons for today.‚Äù\n\n\u003EHe acknowledged that postwar Japan had established civilian control, but warned that ‚Äúit is merely a system, and without proper implementation, it is meaningless.‚Äù\n\n\u003EHe wrote, ‚ÄúWe must not repeat a history where emotional and spiritual judgments are prioritized over calm and rational decisions, causing the nation to err in its course.‚Äù\n\n\"Let's keep calm and not lose our heads over this,\" is a good stance to run a country from and it's probably a largely unspoken factor in why postwar Japan has been generally stable and prosperous. But if *that's* what he's calling the point of his speech, it feels like a waste of time. The problem with vaguely and abstractly calling for calm and rational decision-making is that the irate and irrational people agitating the system think they're calm and rational. A person who can recognize on their own that they need to calm down never needs to be told to calm down, and a person who can't recognize on their own that they need to calm down is likely to just get irritated by the call. A good leader doesn't inspire change by naming a method, they inspire change by articulating a vision that can be achieved with that method.\n\nI hope this is a call for the LDP to rethink letting their warhawk faction take the lead, and I hope the people who need to be influenced read between the lines. But for a leadership address on the anniversary of one of the most pivotal events in a nation's history, I'm pretty underwhelmed.",

      "A ban on photographing and filming people without their permission appears set to be signed into law in Uzbekistan after the country‚Äôs parliament voted in favor of the legislation on October 7.\n\nThe law would require verbal or written approval from people being photographed or filmed, with fines of up to $1,364 and confiscation of camera equipment for violations. The legislation awaits senate approval but that step is largely viewed as ceremonial in the Central Asian country.\n\nAnzor Bukharsky, a high-profile Uzbek photographer who leads photo expeditions for tourists told RFE/RL that much remains unclear about how the law would be enforced and how it would apply in the case of crowds and incidental figures in a photo. ‚ÄúCan a citizen claim that the person in the photograph is really them if they are wearing a gas mask or Santa Claus makeup?‚Äù\nSchool children trying on gas masks in Bukhara.\nSchool children trying on gas masks in Bukhara.\n\nUzbek lawmakers have presented the ban as a way to protect people‚Äôs privacy, especially children, with a clause specifying that parents or caregivers must give permission for a child under 16 to be photographed.\n\nCritics point to a series of scandals involving corrupt police and officials caught on camera as the potential motivator for the new law. A draft of the legislation was first proposed in 2020 that would forbid the publication of images and recordings. In the law‚Äôs current version that has been expanded to include such recordings‚Äô \"capture and storage.\"",

It also urged residents in coastal areas in the affected zone \"to immediately evacuate to higher grounds or move farther inland\". There were no immediate reports of damage.\n\nThe United States Tsunami Warning System also issued a tsunami threat, saying hazardous waves were possible for coasts within 300km of the quake's epicentre. In the half-hour after the initial quake, the USGA also recorded multiple aftershocks in a similar location, including tremors of magnitudes ranging between 5.6 and 6.0.",

The other 50% of the time you'll get no warning - the water will just start getting deeper and deeper all of a sudden.\n\nIf the water starts receding drastically from the shore then that's evidence that a tsunami is on its way. But if you hear about an earthquake or something like that in your region, or hear about tsunami warnings, then don't just check the sea and assume all must be well if it isn't receding, because it's a toss of the coin whether the sea will pull back before a tsunami strikes."

      "(Not related to Article) \n\nWhat makes this timing even more interesting is that India‚Äôs decision to restore its embassy in Kabul comes 1 day after Pakistan carried out airstrikes inside Afghan territory targeting Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) camps which caused civilian casualties.  \n\nWhile Islamabad justified the operation as a counterterror measure, it triggered strong backlash from Kabul, with the Taliban warning Pakistan against violating Afghan sovereignty. India stepping in right after that with a move to normalize and expand engagement with the Taliban looks like a calculated diplomatic play, positioning itself as a more stable and respectful regional partner",
      "TL;DR, \nIndia has formally restored its full-fledged embassy in Kabul, upgrading its earlier Technical Mission into a permanent diplomatic mission, a move that signals a renewed engagement with the Taliban-led government. \n\nThe decision followed a meeting in New Delhi between External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and Afghanistan‚Äôs Acting Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, where both sides discussed cooperation in security, reconstruction, trade, healthcare, and connectivity. India announced six new development projects and the supply of medical equipment, including MRI and CT machines, vaccines, and ambulances.\n\nTalks also covered mining exploration, water management, and resuming direct flights between Kabul and New Delhi. India emphasized its concerns over cross-border terrorism and noted the Taliban‚Äôs apparent willingness to address security issues affecting Indian interests. \n\nThis restoration of the embassy marks a significant diplomatic shift, balancing humanitarian assistance and infrastructure support with cautious strategic engagement in a region where India seeks to safeguard influence amid the competing roles of Pakistan, China, and Western powers.",

Intersting timing.\n\nLooks like US wants to Box afganistan and like the old times use pakistan to target them untill they have no other choice other than accepting America's demands .Trump has mentioned recently that they want the Bagram Airbase back again .\n\nAfgan Pak border is going to be a battleground for American proxy war . \"AGAIN\".\n\nPS -  Pakistan has bombed Kabul today .

      "Part of the article, although it's much longer than this:\n\n\n\u003E Venezuelan officials, hoping to end their country‚Äôs clash with the United States, offered the Trump administration a dominant stake in Venezuela‚Äôs oil and other mineral wealth in discussions that lasted for months, according to multiple people close to the talks.\n\n\n\u003E The far-reaching offer remained on the table as the Trump administration called the government of President Nicol√°s Maduro of Venezuela  a ‚Äúnarco-terror cartel,‚Äù amassed warships in the Caribbean and began blowing up boats that American officials say were carrying drugs from Venezuela.\n\n\n\u003E Under a deal discussed between a senior U.S. official and Mr. Maduro‚Äôs top aides, the Venezuelan strongman offered to open up all existing and future oil and gold projects to American companies, give preferential contracts to American businesses, reverse the flow of Venezuelan oil exports from China to the United States, and slash his country‚Äôs energy and mining contracts with Chinese, Iranian and Russian firms.\n\n\n\u003E The Trump administration ended up rebuffing Mr. Maduro‚Äôs economic concessions and cut off diplomacy with Venezuela last week. The move effectively killed the deal, at least for now, the people close to the discussion said.\n\n\n\u003E Publicly, the Venezuelan government has responded to Mr. Trump‚Äôs military escalation with defiance and vows to defend what it calls a socialist revolution started in the 1990s by Mr. Maduro‚Äôs late predecessor and mentor Hugo Ch√°vez. At the same time, Mr. Maduro has said he remains open to negotiations and his government continues accepting deportation flights from the United States.\n\n\n\u003E Behind the scenes, however, Venezuela‚Äôs senior officials, with Mr. Maduro‚Äôs blessing, have offered Washington far-reaching concessions that would essentially eliminate the vestiges of resource nationalism at the core of Mr. Ch√°vez‚Äôs movement.",

This party is hostile to the EU and Ukraine and friendly to Russia. I expect most people are familiar with this part.\n\nNow they got a serious new challenger party in the opposition, Tisza, which heavily leans into using tech to sidestep the capture of traditional media. This includes things like rhe currently discussed mobile app, or an anonymized corruption reporting tool using TOR's onion protocol.\n\nNaturally this results in the incumbent ruling party leaning heavily into scare tactics, accusing Tisza of being controlled by the EU and Ukraine. Index is not an independent publication, and FIDESZ did not react to the report. They wrote it.\n\nWhile FIDESZ claims it's Ukrainian devs who stole the recently leaked user data, Tisza suspects an inside job by a current admin with database access, not a contracted developer. Neither side has real proof for now, but it's worth mentioning that FIDESZ is exceptionally untrustworthy about Ukrainian involvement in Tisza, as they have been already making shit up and spending millions of euros on anti ukraine propaganda before this dataleak.",

      "For context: this CNN article summarizes Pope Leo‚Äôs new apostolic exhortation, a document titled *Dilexi te.* For those not especially familiar with the inner workings of the Catholic Church, an apostolic exhortation is a formal exercise of the Church‚Äôs teaching authority‚Äîso what Leo has stated here enters into formal Church teaching. (You may recall how Pope Francis‚Äô first apostolic exhortation, *Evangelii Gaudium,* sent shockwaves throughout the Church, owing in particular to its condemnation of an unhealthy preoccupation with niche points of doctrine at the expense of the main thrust of the Gospel.)\n\nAs the CNN article summarizes, the pope‚Äôs focus in the document is the poor, and he spends time criticizing economic inequality and the inhumane treatment of migrants. The text‚Äîwhich was first drafted by Francis‚Äîrepeats several major themes from Francis‚Äô pontificate, such as a condemnation of an ‚Äúeconomy that kills,‚Äù and of a ‚Äúthrowaway culture.‚Äù My read is that this document clearly indicates Leo‚Äôs desire to broadly continue in the same vein as Pope Francis even if stylistically this papacy is quite distinct.\n\nThe full text of the apostolic exhortation is available here: https://www.vatican.va/content/leo-xiv/en/apost_exhortations/documents/20251004-dilexi-te.html\n\nEdit: removed a typo",
      "Oh man. Merciful and loving religious people are NOT going to like this",
      "Reading the comments in here... Can we not chastise the pope for sitting in his glass castle and writing things that are actually reasonable and promote good discourse on the state of the world as it is today. \n\nIf we're going to fix this we're going to have to start supporting each other regardless of our religion, socio economic status, etc. Otherwise we're feeding into this chaotic agenda of me vs. you just like everyone else.\n\nI, like many others here, am not predominantly religious but I quite like that there's a dogma shift in the catholic church and it's one of the only institutions where they're actually looking at themselves and realizing that they're not teaching the right things and that there's more important issues that need to be addressed. Yes, this won't get into the majority of the churches but having the reach that they do, this is an important step in unifying the general consensus and hopefully moving in the right direction. They're doing what we want them to do. It's just going to move at their own pace and we have to accept that.",

      "\u003E Lawmakers had set up a debate and impeachment trial late Thursday in the 130-member unicameral Congress after voting to accept four requests for a vote to remove Boluarte from office over what they said was her government's inability to stem crime.\n\u003E\n\u003EThey requested that Boluarte come before them shortly before midnight to defend herself, but when she did not appear they immediately voted to oust her. In short order, 124 lawmakers voted just past midnight to impeach Boluarte. There were no votes against the effort.\n\u003E\n\u003EThe shocking turn of events came just hours after a shooting at a concert in the capital inflamed anger over crime roiling the country.\n\u003E\n\u003EUnlike eight previous attempts to remove her, almost all legislative factions expressed support for the latest requests.\n\u003E\n\u003EBoluarte took office in December 2022 after Parliament used the same mechanism to impeach her predecessor.\n\u003E\n\u003EThe constitution calls for the president of the Congress to be next in the line of succession, but it was not immediately clear if it would be the body's current leader or if lawmakers would select another among them.\n\u003E\n\u003EPeru's first female president was its sixth leader in just under a decade. A normal presidential term is five years. Her term had been scheduled to end July 28, 2026 and elections had been scheduled for next April.\n\u003E\n\u003EIn Peru, criminal gangs are targeting schools in poor neighborhoods for extortion\nBoluarte assumed power in Peru in 2022 to complete the term of then-President Pedro Castillo, who was removed from office just two years into his five-year term after attempting to dissolve the legislature to avoid his own removal. She had served as Castillo's vice president before becoming president.\n\u003E\n\u003EThere were more than 500 protests demanding her resignation in the first three months of her presidency.\n\u003E\n\u003EPlagued by scandals, her administration's inability to address Peru's incessant crime proved to be her undoing.\n\u003E\n\u003EOn Wednesday, she partially blamed the situation on immigrants living in the country illegally.\n\u003E\n\u003E\"This crime has been brewing for decades and has been strengthened by illegal immigration, which past administrations haven't defeated,\" she said during a military ceremony. \"Instead, they've opened the doors of our borders and allowed criminals to enter everywhere... without any restrictions.\"\n\u003E\n\u003EOfficial figures show that 6,041 people were killed between January and mid-August, the highest number during the same period since 2017. Meanwhile, extortion complaints totaled 15,989 between January and July, a 28% increase compared to the same period in 2024.\n\u003E\n\u003EThe country's latest presidential crisis erupted after a man opened fire and injured five people Wednesday during a concert of Peru's most popular cumbia groups, Agua Marina.\n\u003E\n\u003EPrime Minister Eduardo Arana on Thursday defended Boluarte during a crime-focused hearing before Parliament, but it was not enough to dissuade lawmakers from pursuing the motions to see the president out of office.\n\u003E\n\u003E\"Parliament's concerns are not resolved by addressing a request for impeachment, much less by approving it,\" Arana told lawmakers. \"We are not clinging to our positions. We are here, and we knew from the beginning that our first day here could also be our last day in office.\"",

Dozens of people have died at this point but **ALL** of them are still unidentified.  The only thing I've seen from any source of who they are is a New York Times reporter talking to an anonymous source saying her husband was a fisherman who went out one day and never returned but again that is an anonymous source so literally every one has died is anonymous.\n\nNow you have the Colombian president saying that he thinks maybe possibly they were Colombian but he isn't giving any other evidence than \"hinting\" that they are?\n\nHow the hell are dozens of these people just unidentified at this point?  A boat is literally getting blown up with a video tape being released showing \"this is the boat that blew up.  This one right here\".  And there isn't a port anywhere in South America where a single person steps forward and says \"Yes. I know that boat.\"  Just crickets?\n\n  What is going on?",
      "Yep White House and whoever is running this is sabotaging whatever the fuck they think they are doing.\n\nHowever, I would not be surprised if Petro is claiming it to start a war. \n\nPetro has already gone on record calling NATO an army of darkness and many similar things.\n\nPetro has a vision of gran colombia and 'former' colombian soldiers are very involved on both sides of the ukranian war among other wars.\n\npersonally i have petro locked as a russian toadie\n\nPetro has also done joint exercises with venezuela",

      "The US already has the massively promising findings in Guyana, and is now involved in their oil production. It‚Äôs going to be swimming in easy-to-access oil very soon. \n\nTrump going after Maduro is unlikely to be about oil, and is instead probably due to Maduro‚Äôs malign influence in the region‚Äîincluding in Colombia itself.",
      "The US really needs to strengthen ties with our southern neighbors... this crap being pulled will cause generational probs.",
      "\u003EHe went on to claim that what the Trump administration really wants is \"Venezuela and Guyana's oil, that's it.\"\n\"The use of anti-economic and murderous missiles has another goal. You want to harass us to get the oil for free,\" Petro added.\n\nPresident *Petro* alleging a War for Oil. Petro. We live in a Simulation, come on now. What, Prime Minister Diesel and Presidente U√±leaded where unavailable for comment?"

Akitu used to be celebrated as a 6 day festival of feasting, celebration and prayer that culminated in the ritual humiliation of the king of Babylon by stripping him naked and getting slapped by the high priest. It was considered especially good fortunes for the coming harvest of the year if the slap was so hard it drew tears from the king.\n\n\nWhen the ancient Assyrians had control over Babylon some of them were known to have stayed in Babylon to and participated in the Akitu festival (and getting stripped naked and slapped).\n\n\nIt's cool to see the festival still survived into modern times. Though I imagine the leader of Assyria doesn't publicly get stripped naked and slapped. Maybe in private... if they're into that sort of thing."

Hamas demanded concessions from Israel and Israel is forced to accept them. Hamas uses the concessions to prepare the next war. Hamas then has someone such as the Houthi's attack Israel. When Israel retaliates against this group Hamas claims that this \"violated the ceasefire\" and attacks again even though the ceasefire was with Hamas\n\nAnd I know this is what's going to happen because it's what happened with the previous ceasefire. Hamas used Israeli police responding to a terror attack in Jerusalem as their excuse to break the ceasefire even though it was Israeli police, not the military, responding to something inside Israel, not Palestine",

      "There's a lot of context on this which people may have missed.\n\nThe rupee is not a freely traded freely converted currency, India exerts considerable control over its balance of payments. People may assume that all currencies work like the dollar where if someone pays you in dollars you can just buy whatever you need from wherever you want with it. That is not the case.\n\nIf you're a Russian oil exporter and you sell oil to India then India will, if at all possible, pay you by depositing rupees into your account at an Indian bank. You don't have free control over the money, you can't do what you like with it.\n\nYou can use your rupees to invest in the Indian economy if you like, such as buying equities or state issued bonds. But in that scenario India is getting oil and also keeping the money. Russia gets some kind of IOU or capital stake, but what they don't get is Chinese made dual use components. They don't get something they can use for the war effort.\n\nOr you can use rupees to buy Indian goods made with Indian labour. That's supported by the currency controls. An Indian exporter agrees to send you a freighter filled with Indian made motorbikes and you instruct the Indian bank to transfer the rupees from your account to theirs. But again, the currency stays within India.\n\nThis is all by design, it's part of India's broader trade strategy to facilitate domestic investment, stimulate demand for Indian goods, and maintain control over its currency. Think of it like a business that refuses to pay refunds in cash, only store credit.\n\nNaturally this annoys the hell out of their customers. Russia has been trying to get India to pay it for oil in dollars for years because Russia has shit to buy from countries all around the world and it needs dollars. To Russia everyone else pays in dollars (or euros which are also freely convertible), why the hell won't India. To which the Indian government responds \"feel free to sell the oil for dollars elsewhere, if you can find a buyer, lol\". They have Russia over a barrel and they fucking know it.\n\nThis is part of the broader strategy of keeping Russian crude oil as part of global supply to avoid rampant inflation due to global oil shortages while also ensuring that Russia gets fucked. Russia selling oil to India isn't a loophole, it's the plan working as intended. India isn't somehow hurting the west, it is playing its part. Someone needed to be the nakedly self interested party that fucked Russia on the oil sales and the west knew that they could count on India to be that nakedly self interested fucker.\n\nSo that's the context on the currency fight here. Russian state oil exporters are once again asking India to stop paying them in store credit because they need yuan to buy stuff from China. India is still doing all it can to pay in store credit because they don't just want the oil, they want to keep the money they paid for the oil in India.\n\nThe Indian refiners are not asking to pay in yuan, they are asked, they're receiving the request from a Russia begging to get a currency it can actually use. India has been cooperating somewhat with Russia's requests to be paid in other currencies, but its just one more factor that depresses the price Russia gets.\n\nFor additional context, here's Lavrov complaining about not being able to spend rupees.\nhttps://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/russia-india-ruble-rupee-sanctions-trade-imbalance-yuan-weapons-deficit-2023-5\n\u003E \"As for rupees, this is a problem because there are billions of rupees accumulated in accounts at Indian banks and we need to use this money,\"",

      "\u003Eand now roughly 40% of Russian refining capacity has been brought offline\n\nhmmmm...this from the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center:\n\n\u003EThere has been a lot of speculation in recent days about how much damage Ukrainian drone attacks have done to Russia‚Äôs oil refineries, with some news outlets[ claiming](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/10/02/russia-oil-refining-attacks-shortage/) Russia has lost 38 percent of its oil refining capacity. While this figure might have some formal basis in fact, the real state of affairs is far more complex.\n\n\u003EOn paper, Russia can refine 327 million tons of oil every year (or 6.5 million barrels per day). And the capacity of the 16 refineries that have been attacked by Ukrainian drones in August and September is 123 million tons a year‚Äîor 38 percent of the total. **In other words, 38 percent is the upper limit of potential damage.**\n\n...\n\n\u003EThere are three important questions that must be answered when attempting to assess the current level of damage to Russia‚Äôs oil refineries: were they working at full capacity before the attacks? Was the damage complete or partial? Has the damage been repaired or is it still hindering throughput?\n\n\u003EWhile there is not enough publicly available information to provide exhaustive answers, we can draw some conclusions. During the 2024 campaign, most refineries kept operating‚Äîat least in part‚Äîafter attacks, and had restored full output within weeks‚Äîand this is true today. **The Volgograd refinery, for example, was able to fully repair the damage from attacks by multiple drones on August 13 and August 14, and had restored full operations by August 25.**\n\nIt's well worth the read.\n\n[https://carnegieendowment.org/russia-eurasia/politika/2025/10/russia-refinery-damages?lang=en&utm\\_source=carnegieemail&utm\\_medium=email&utm\\_campaign=autoemail&mkt\\_tok=ODEzLVhZVS00MjIAAAGdSdImLeBhD3ODIQ7ZC4F5YBLdBV\\_GJv4ExqO\\_QQ4c6I4kFXrc\\_WVpO\\_n9gryyon\\_csuXIb5WPJ0M2LWVp0gubQVAhe5q7RzFSLUxgCVhrpVjL](https://carnegieendowment.org/russia-eurasia/politika/2025/10/russia-refinery-damages?lang=en&utm_source=carnegieemail&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=autoemail&mkt_tok=ODEzLVhZVS00MjIAAAGdSdImLeBhD3ODIQ7ZC4F5YBLdBV_GJv4ExqO_QQ4c6I4kFXrc_WVpO_n9gryyon_csuXIb5WPJ0M2LWVp0gubQVAhe5q7RzFSLUxgCVhrpVjL)",

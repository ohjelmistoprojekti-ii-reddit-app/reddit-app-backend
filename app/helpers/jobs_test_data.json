          "After months of being rejected right after applying, I finally got a job!",
          "Got caught off guard with a callback, tanked it and got the dreaded rejection email today. I know it's a numbers game, but damn if it doesn't suck.",
          "I am stuck in a $20.50/hr video production specialist job in PA that refuses to give raises or even supply the proper equipment I need in order to build my resume. A month ago, I had an opportunity at a company with amazing benefits and a campus setup with free gym and lunch. I interviewed four rounds over the course of a month and made it to the final round, using up all my current place's PTO in order to interview with them because I liked them that much (also, 40% pay increase with is more like 45-50% with the benefits). My current place does not offer sick days and does not offer any vacation time, so it is very sparingly. After feeling confident about my interviews and making it passed the final round, I was expecting an offer sometime today, instead I was denied. I feel like I am going to be stuck in my situation forever. I'm not even sure how to continue on. Fortunately, the only win is that I didn't tell anybody at my current place I was interviewing elsewhere so I don't need to worry about losing my current role. Though, it may not be so bad to go down the street and work as a barista at Starbucks for better pay and benefits. RIP me.",
          "Separated from my last job at the end of Feb (I say separated because I had considered quitting with nothing lined up). \n\nSpent the last 4 months living my best daily life - adventures with my dogs, long runs, biking to the pool and jumping off the diving board over and over, making sure my wife and I had something good to eat when she finished work, and kind of passively looking for work, but \\*meaning it\\* when I saw the right opportunity. \n\nIt was the best \"me\" day, every day, for 4 months. \n\nEnded up getting a great job at a company where I 'know' people that I've never worked with, but have been on my radar through mutual connections over the years. Demolished every step of the interview process. \n\nUntil this offer, I'd had a few rounds here and there, but nothing had me feeling very excited (and the ones I was excited about didn't choose me back). \n\nThis one popped up because I received good panel feedback from a role that I didn't get.\n\nMore pay, new (but familiar and adjacent) responsibilities, and with an industry focus that I've always been curious about. \n\nThis whole thing reeks of privilege, but I \\*did\\* earn every cent of my 24 month emergency fund after a decade of non-stop professional insanity.  Live below your means if it's possible. I'm an anxious person, so not \\*needing\\* a job immediately helped a ton with interviewing.",
          "Finally found a job after 3000+ resumes!!!!  Doing community outreach for 15 months for my city government. Signed the offer letter yesterday and start next week! \n\nAnd in addition I managed to successfully advocate for myself by getting ahead of the curve in informing my supervisor about the Jewish High Holidays in October that will take me away from work! Thankfully after that month theres no need to make a notice about religious absence until April 15th and June 2 so I can accrue more days after that.",
          "Disappointment: \n\nI had a promising job interview but did not get that job. \n\nI had another promising job interview but after thinking about the pay, I realized that this job would pay me less than the cost of childcare for my kids. Thus, I would be \\*paying\\* 50 cents per hour to work. \n\nIt's pretty discouraging.",
          "Disappointment: was hoping to hear back from an opportunity I interviewed for on the 20th….. my friend is a recruiter at such company and got my resume in front of the hiring manager…. I felt I was a perfect match on paper of the job requisition…the interview I felt went well….\n\n. Recruiter tells me they’re usually quick to hire…. And…….crickets. So I reached out yesterday for follow up…. Crickets. My buddy recruiting says the dude has been out of the office for 2 weeks but they liked me the best so far out of who they interviewed…ok great….then the week goes by….Main recruiter doesn’t respond to my emails or his emails….. \n\nSo much for networking…I swear you can’t make this up \n\nI’m just so sick of this job market….

          "Started a job last week, but with each passing day it feels more like a bait and switch or catfishing. How convenient that the job details change/restructured after being hired, while retaining the low salary of the job I was hired for. I'm going to try to keep looking for a job while \"employed\", but feelsbadman.\n\nYup, got bait and switched into a subcontractor role.",

          "You wouldn't get in legal trouble le but it could call into question if you are going to get paid. Usually when you are terminated you are terminated from a company. This would include other locations, if you were to work, in a sense you were aware you were terminated from the company but still chose to pick up a shift. Your employment agreement with them is no longer valid as they ended it so yeah, its more so risky on your end as they dont have to pay you technically if you were to work that shift and it can be argued in favor of the employer. I would move on or contact HR to see if you are actually terminated or the manager may have hoped you stopped showing up so he can then properly fire you for missed shifts",

If there is cash handling involved and you gave the bad luck of coming up short....they could really go after you.  If you slip and fall and are injured, your workers comp would be in jeopardy.   There is more in play here than just showing up to work.  And by the time this shift comes around, what happens if your numbers font work?  Nie it us embarrassing and messy.",
          "Orrrrr ... you could sign up for lots of shifts at other locations, and not show up. Because you're fired, right?\n\nI know this isn't the AITA sub, or the pettyyrevenge sub, but the opportunity is right there. I don't know if showing up and working would be illegal, but signing up to work is def not illegal, and they did leave you access to the system.",
          "Sounds like they rehired you. You work the hours, you get paid for it. \n\nMaybe they're so inept and in need of workers that you just fall through cracks and just keep working. Worse case scenario you give HR and accounting a headache because they have to re-enroll you in the system so they can pay you. At least you'll get a good laugh out of it when you cash the check.",

Basically I was fired from my job a couple weeks ago (GM made up a policy and fired several of us for it; went to HR and trying to get my job back)… but my manager hasn’t yet restricted my access to the online platform and I can still see shifts from other stores. \n\nI requested to pick up a shift from a different location and the GM from that location accepted it. Obviously she does not know I was fired. I want to go in and work this shift because it seems like I can get paid for it, and I’ve been authorized to do so. \n\nI’m just wondering if it’s illegal for me to do this because I technically don’t work there anymore. I don’t want them finding out in the middle of the shift, they call the police, and then I’m prosecuted or something. I don’t want to get into legal trouble. \n\nShould I attempt to work this shift?

It's always lower risk to hire someone with a trusted referral then someone unknown.\n\nYou should take a hard look at your responses in interviews, could be you're a great candidate but a red flag comes up (dishonesty, saying negative things about previous coworkers or companies, appearing to be running from a job rather than running to a job).  \n\nThere may be interview skills you need to improve.

If in doubt, the servers which are regularly pinged for updates are probably different from most other phones depending on what apps you have installed, this can be used as your network fingerprint to identify your device between a few others connecting at the same time.

A while in, things became clear that our boss was pretty sketchy in terms of how well he facilitates and oversees things. At some point, he stopped paying us all together. We have 2 weeks worked and logged via the workforce app that haven’t been paid by our employer, so I was just wondering if there’s anything we can do about it? My employer owns a LLC company, or that’s what we’re signed on to work for, I have his corresponding info like numbers, emails, etc, but is this even worth pursuing? I’ve heard you can write reviews on the BBB or something along those lines, but any advice here would be appreciated. \n\nAt this point, we’ve stopped showing up, and are looking for employment elsewhere, but if it matters for authenticity, neither of us have willingly quit this job, nor has our employer reached out to say we’re fired or something. He just simply won’t pay us, although I believe he’s legally obligated to. Thank you for any advice. ",

          "I had an old boss who said it was kind of an unwritten rule that as long as you didn't take the interview after accepting the offer, that taking one offer, then backing out and accepting a better one when it came in, they were OK with it.  The only time they might hold a grudge is if someone took their offer then started accepting interviews at other places.  \n\nYour choices are pretty limited.  Personally I'd just make the best decisions for you and accept the best offer when it comes.  You aren't hurting the companies as much as you think by accepting offers then backing out.  \n\nOther option is just to be honest with the small company and tell them you're waiting for a potential offer that you think is a better opportunity that pays more.  Although I'd expect they might just break off contact with you when you do that.  \n\nI have accepted then un-accepted offers when better ones came in before.  It's common.  It's not a huge deal usually."

        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m in a bit of a tricky spot and could use some advice on how to reply.\n\nI’ve been interviewing for a role at a company that will likely take at least another week to wrap up the process. If it works out, this role would pay about 1.5x higher than my other option.\n\nAt the same time, a small firm I interviewed with a couple of months ago (who really liked me but didn’t have room back then) just reached out. The owner emailed me asking if I’m still available and what my timeline looks like. I know they could extend an offer quickly if I say yes.\n\nHere’s the complication: I had a very personal referral to this small firm. I don’t want to accept an offer and then back out if the other role works out. That would feel unfair to the people who vouched for me. But I also don’t want to miss the chance if the bigger role falls through.\n\nSo my questions are:\n\n* How would you reply to the small firm in a way that buys some time without burning bridges?\n* How do you balance a quick potential offer vs. waiting for a slower process with a higher-paying role?\n\nThanks in advance for your advice!",

          "Absolutely go for it! \nIn 2022 I applied for a county case manager position and I got the job offer. Unfortunately because of my financial situation I declined it. I was honest with them when I declined it and told them once my financial situation is better I will watch for future job postings. They were really appreciative and understanding.\nFast forward to 2025 just a couple months ago I applied for the same position at the county and got interviewed by the same 3 people as when I originally interviewed. It wasn’t awkward at all and they asked if I was in a better position, etc. \nI’ve been working the county job for almost a month now. \n\nSo definitely doesn’t hurt to apply again!",

If anything, it shows you’re serious this time around. \n\nChances are, if they thought you were a strong candidate before, they still see value in you, so just show that you’re ready to jump in this time.

I almost accepted but I was talked out of it from a couple of my closer colleagues. I deeply regretted not jumping at the opportunity ever since and now the position is open again. I’m really not in a good place where I am due to several factors and I am so far over it, I was 15 months ago. \nI am thinking of sending in my application again but wonder if it’s in bad form or taste. I don’t want to insult them but I’d really like that shot. They offered it to me once, so maybe they still consider me an asset or I ruined it forever! I would not let them down this time. I realize it’s probably got its own set of new problems since they reopened it pretty quickly but really just need a change. Any thoughts? ",

          "Losing that sense of fulfilment can be really draining. Sometimes it’s a sign you need a new challenge, sometimes it’s burnout. Reflect on what parts of your job you like and what you’d change. Is there anything you could change (or maybe a manager could help with) that would make your current position feel more inspiring to you?  \n  \nWhen I feel like that, I sometimes browse companies and roles on Flexa to see what else is out there. It's reassuring to me personally to see employers who prioritise flexibility and purpose. Doesn't mean you need to jump into anything new right away, but seeing what else is out there might give you some ideas around what might feel more fulfilling"

I’m the go to trainer and a bucket of knowledge for the store. Here’s my issue though, for the last year or so I haven’t been getting the same fulfillment I got when I started. I feel like it has been caused by the company switching directions so many times over the past years, overall burnout, and just in general wanting more. A big sale doesn’t get me excited like it used to, so I’ve been weighing options. \n\n\nOption 1: Management within the company\nPros: \n-management on my resume \n- Slightly higher pay\n- Not actively selling ( side selling yes)\n\nCons:\nStill working for the same company\nHours suck dick\nHave to drink some corporate kool-aid\n\n\nOption 2: use my sales and customer service experience in something like CSM ( customer success manager)\n\nPros;\nSomething new \nIn a field I can be more passionate about \nMixes what I actually like from my day-day now.\n\nCons; \nProbably less pay \nStarting from 0 with a new company \n\nNow put yourself in my shoes. You’re 25 years old. You haven’t screwed yourself but you got some debts to pay off. I don’t want to hate what I’m doing and then blink and I’m 35 more jaded than I am now, and be the exact thing I promised myself I wouldn’t be when I was a kid. \n\nWhat I really want is a job I can make money from that way I can do my own thing sooner than later. I know I’m not meant for a normal job under someone else, I just don’t know how to get myself to a self sustaining state without working a “normal job” first. I come from a family that is the epitome of poverty. \n\n\n ",

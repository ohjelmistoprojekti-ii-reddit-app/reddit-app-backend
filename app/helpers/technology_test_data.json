          "Wondering if the ‚ÄúAI bubble‚Äù will be the scapegoat/coverup for the collapse. Will it be used in order to hide a more realistic reason? Like the massive financial corruption (see Wallstreet) and grift (see government) going on right now?",
          "Here's the relevant part for those who don't want to create the free account required to click through:\n\nInvestments in artificial intelligence have exploded, accounting for roughly two-thirds of nationwide economic growth this year. The top seven Big Tech firms ‚Äî Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla ‚Äî account for more than one-third of all the wealth on the S&P 500, and AI deals now account for a whopping 63 percent of all venture capital investments. Yet, a recent study found that 95 percent of tech investment groups polled reported zero return on their huge bets on generative AI ‚Äî leading experts to warn that the industry is forming a bubble, and that when it pops, it could take down the entire economy. \n\n    ‚ÄúIn short, AI better work ‚Äî or else,‚Äù warns Reuters financial analyst Mike Dolan.\n\nRace to the bottom. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs definitely a possibility‚Ä¶ based on past large infrastructure build-outs and how they led to bubbles, that something like that would happen here,‚Äù Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently admitted about AI crash worries. In the 19th century, speculative investment, oversupply, and lack of regulation led to a railroad bubble and crash that wiped out 89 of the country‚Äôs 364 rail builders ‚Äî a pattern that repeated itself with dot-com mania at the turn of the 20th century.\n\n    For megacorporations like Meta, it‚Äôs just about outlasting the competition. ‚ÄúThe infrastructure gets built out, people take on too much debt, and then you hit some blip‚Ä¶ a lot of the companies end up going out of business, and then the assets get distressed, and then it‚Äôs a great opportunity to go buy more,‚Äù Zuckerberg said.\n\nIn the red. The biggest firms may already be struggling. OpenAI, the venture capital-funded maker of ChatGPT, recorded $5 billion in losses in 2024 and $3.7 billion in revenue. Despite expectations putting the company‚Äôs earnings at $20 billion this year, the firm is bleeding cash on huge expenditures faster than it can turn a profit, despite a recent eyebrow-raising $100 billion bailout from software chipmaker Nvidia, one of OpenAI‚Äôs own suppliers (a circular deal that investors also liken to the dot-com bubble).\n\n    ‚ÄúI think the rational thing to do is to just be willing to run the loss for quite a while,‚Äù OpenAI founder Sam Altman said last month.\n\nThat‚Äôs it? Consumers are shouldering the burden for the AI boom while reaping surprisingly few of the benefits promised. Electricity bills are skyrocketing nationwide thanks to the massive amounts of energy required to power AI. In Ohio, a proposed bill would allow utilities to remotely control consumers‚Äô home thermostats to reduce their energy usage during high demand. And it‚Äôs getting worse: Together, Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft are expected to spend nearly $400 billion in 2025 building data centers to power their AI ‚Äî equivalent to South Africa‚Äôs annual economic output.",
          "The biggest issue I find is that all this tools are working on taxes and electricity bills. Data centers promised work and living improvements but unlike roads they aren't helping their local communities. it's all socialized cost and privatization of profits.",
          "Have you noticed that there‚Äôs always a gold rush with tech companies? AI, NFTs, the metaverse, etc. Hell, even the internet itself was a gold rush a few decades ago. Now we‚Äôre in a situation where the big tech firms are dropping a staggering amount of capital into making these incremental improvements to a product that is, to put it charitably, pretty lackluster. We‚Äôre hundreds of billions of dollars into developing this thing, and everyone knows the big breakthroughs that have been promised are simply not going to happen, at least in the near term. \n\nAll of this for a product that, even if they get it to work as well as they want it to, would effectively end employment opportunities for a huge chunk of the labor force. Then we get to the very simple, yet very large problem: if the majority of people are unemployed, how are they supposed to survive in a country with zero safety net? Furthermore, how can an economy exist when there are no jobs because companies are unwilling to hire human beings, and those same companies can no longer sell goods because nobody has any money? Seriously, what‚Äôs the end goal here? \n\nIf you remove workers from the economy, you will eventually have no economy. If you want to sell shit, people have to be able to buy shit. If you want those people to buy shit, you have to give them money. Since no company on earth is going to just give away money, that necessitates an exchange of money for labor, but that means diverting money from profits to workers. That means the trillion dollars we spent on developing AI was a colossal waste because it is antithetical to the very basic fundamentals of a functioning economy.",
          "The AI bubble is scary because right now it‚Äôs one of the last legs propping the economy up. Just about every single indicator outside of tech spending/consumption shows that we are in one of the biggest recessions of modern history.\n\nThe economy is not going to bounce back either. If markets collapse, it‚Äôll be more incentive for businesses to automate more jobs (much like they did during covid), but now they‚Äôll be able to automate significantly more jobs by introducing AI tools.",

          "Key details from the reporting below:\n\n\u003EThe documents explicitly show that ICE is choosing this product over others offered by the contractor‚Äôs competitors because it gives ICE essentially an ‚Äúall-in-one‚Äù tool for searching both masses of location data and information taken from social media. The documents also show that ICE is planning to once again use location data remotely harvested from peoples‚Äô smartphones after previously saying it had stopped the practice.\n\u003E\n\u003E...\n\u003E\n\u003E‚ÄúThe Biden Administration shut down DHS‚Äôs location data purchases after an inspector general found that DHS had broken the law. Every American should be concerned that Trump's hand-picked security force is once again buying and using location data without a warrant,‚Äù Senator Ron Wyden told 404 Media in a statement.\n\u003E\n\u003EThe ICE document is redacted but says a product made by a contractor called Penlink ‚Äúleverages a proprietary data platform to compile, process, and validate billions of daily location signals from hundreds of millions of mobile devices, providing both forensic and predictive analytics.‚Äù The products the document is discussing are Tangles and Webloc.\n\u003E\n\u003EForbes previously reported that ICE spent more than $5 million on these products, including $2 million for Tangles specifically. Tangles and Webloc used to be run by an Israeli company called Cobwebs. Cobwebs joined Penlink in July 2023.\n\u003E\n\u003EThe new documents provide much more detail about the sort of location data ICE will now have access to, and why ICE chose to buy access to this vast dataset from Penlink specifically.\n\u003E\n\u003E‚ÄúWithout an all-in-one tool that provides comprehensive web investigations capabilities and automated analysis of location-based data within specified geographic areas, intelligence teams face significant operational challenges,‚Äù the document reads. The agency said that the issue with other companies was that they required analysts to ‚Äúmanually collect and correlate data from fragmented sources,‚Äù which increased the chance of missing ‚Äúconnections between online behaviors and physical movements.‚Äù \n\u003E\n\u003E...\n\u003E\n\u003ERegardless, the documents say that ‚ÄúHSI INTEL requires Penlink's Tangles and Weblocas [sic] an integral part of their investigations mission.‚Äù Although HSI has historically been focused on criminal investigations, 90 percent of HSI have been diverted to carry out immigration enforcement, according to data published by the Cato Institute. Meaning it is unclear whether use of the data will be limited to criminal investigations or not.\n\u003E\n\u003E...\n\u003E\n\u003EIn October 2023, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Inspector General published a report that found ICE, CBP, and the Secret Service all broke the law when using location data harvested from phones. The oversight body found that those DHS components did not have sufficient policies and procedures in place to ensure that the location data was used appropriately. In one case, a CBP official used the technology to track the location of coworkers, the report said.\n\u003E\n\u003E...\n\u003E\n\u003EThe report recommended that CBP stop its use of such data; CBP said at the time it did not intend to renew its contracts anyway. The Inspector General also recommended that ICE stop using such data until it obtained the necessary approvals. But ICE‚Äôs response in the report said it would continue to use the data. ‚ÄúCTD is an important mission contributor to the ICE investigative process as, in combination with other information and investigative methods, it can fill knowledge gaps and produce investigative leads that might otherwise remain hidden. Accordingly, continued use of CTD enables ICE HSI to successfully accomplish its law enforcement mission,‚Äù the response at the time said. \n\u003E\n\u003EIn January 2024, ICE said it had stopped the purchase of such ‚Äúcommercial telemetry data,‚Äù or CTD, which is how DHS refers to location data.\n\nIt certainly looks like from this report that this part of the government believes itself to be above any kind of meaningful oversight. Clearly from a privacy perspective this is deeply problematic, especially as data brokers have an increasing amount of data on pretty much everyone. At this point, is there any meaningful difference between nations that are traditionally considered to be surveillance states, such as China, and those that are traditionally considered to be more open such as the United States?",

          "Best line of the article:\n\n\u003EFiber optic cable lines are often buried underground, protected from the vagaries of southern gunfire.\n\nTexas.",
          "So much of our society relies on people not doing stupid shit. \n\nAs evidenced by the problems now being caused by our federal government doing stupid shit.",
          "From the article: The internet can be more physically vulnerable than you think. Last week, thousands of people in North and Central Texas were suddenly knocked offline. The cause? A bullet. The outage hit cities all across the state, including Dallas, Irving, Plano, Arlington, Austin, and San Antonio. The outage affected Spectrum customers and took down their phone lines and TV services as well as the internet.\n\n‚ÄúRight in the middle of my meetings,‚Äù one users said on the r/Spectrum subreddit. Around 25,000 customers were without services for several hours as the company rushed to repair the lines. As the service came back,, WFAA reported that the cause of the outage came from the barrel of a gun. A stray bullet had hit a line of fiber optic cable and knocked tens of thousands of people offline.\n\n‚ÄúThe outage stemmed from a fiber optic cable that was damaged by a stray bullet,‚Äù Spectrum told 404 Media. ‚ÄúOur teams worked quickly to make the necessary repairs and get customers back online. We apologize for the inconvenience.‚Äù\n\nSpectrum told 404 Media that it didn‚Äôt have any further details to share about the incident so we have no idea how the company learned a bullet hit its equipment, where the bullet was found, and if the police are involved. Texas is a massive state with overlapping police jurisdictions and a lot of guns. Finding a specific shooting incident related to telecom equipment in the vast suburban sprawl around Dallas is probably impossible.\n\nFiber optic cable lines are often buried underground, protected from the vagaries of southern gunfire. But that‚Äôs not always the case, fiber can be strung along telephone poles in the sky and sent to a vast and complicated network junction boxes and service stations that overlap different municipalities and cities, each with their own laws about how the cable can be installed. That can leave pieces of the physical infrastructure of the internet exposed to gunfire and other mischief.\n\nThis is not the first time gunfire has taken down the internet. In 2022, Xfinity fiber cable in Oakland, California went offline after people allegedly fired 17 rounds into the air near one of the company‚Äôs fiber lines. Around 30,000 people were offline during that outage and it happened moments before the start of an NFL game that saw the Los Angeles Rams square off against the San Francisco 49ers.\n\n‚ÄúWe could not be more apologetic and sincerely upset that this is happening on a day like today,‚Äù Comcast spokesperson Joan Hammel told Dater Center Dynamics at the time. Hammel added that the company has seen gunshot wounds on its equipment before. ‚ÄúWhile this isn‚Äôt completely uncommon, it is pretty rare, but we know it when we see it.‚Äù",
          "This happens more often than one might think.\n\nWorked for a FAANG awhile back, and they told a story of how early in their history they had a total data-loss between two datacenters. Direct fiber line just went dark; they could still route traffic through a third intermediary but, of course, this really slowed things down. On-site diagnostics didn't find anything so they put a team together in a pickup truck and started physically driving down the line to see what was up.\n\nGot to a barely-on-the-map town in the middle of America between the two centers and saw it: a fiber junction box absolutely *full* of shotgun holes. Some asshole kids decided it'd be fun to shoot at the weird new thing on the telephone pole. They notified local law enforcement, fixed up the box, and changed policy: boxes from now on would be painted boring greys and browns to make them look as uninteresting as possible.",

          "I used to work for a radiology software company integrating some of the AIs talked about in that article, and have a masters focused on medical imaging acquisition and software processing. It was always sold as a tool for Radiologists to use rather than something to replace them. And from what I've seen it's a great tool but can have false positives and negatives.\n\nWhile I do understand the anti AI backlash (I'm not a fan of shoving it into everything either), using machine learning models for image classification is something we've been doing for decades and shouldn't get grouped in with AI slop. Image classification for Radiology images is a great use case and is a tool to help doctors, not replace them.",
          "\"\\[W\\]e should expect software to initially lead to more human work, not less. The lesson from a decade of radiology models is neither optimism about increased output nor dread about replacement. Models can lift productivity, but their implementation depends on behavior, institutions and incentives.\" If only this was the philosophy of most business leaders who are actively investing in AI.",
          "so I could see ai as a useful utility for analyzing images and highlighting potential concerns, but not being the end all be all. you'd still need a radiologist, but having a list of potential issues highlighted as a starting point may not be bad.\n\nthe problem is that there will be those who only use the ai.",
          "I heard a lot of this 'radiologists will be replaced' when I worked in healthcare, like 10 years ago.\n\nBut then it wasn't \"AI\" that would replace radiologists, but \"big data\" was the on the hype.",

          "I‚Äôve taken radiology. I think a reasonable workflow should be a radiologist will over-read and write a report.  Then feed it through ai and have have the same radiologist read the ai report, and then integrate any useful findings or double check any discrepancies and correct the note with new information gleaned from ai. \n\nWhile I imagine you could do it the other way around where you have the ai check it first, I also imagine that would result in the radiologist getting lazy and missing things under the assumption that the AI is ‚Äúprobably correct‚Äú.",
          "Not the right take on it.\n\nIt boils down to accountability, most doctors, surgeons are contractors rather than direct employees of hospitals to primarily reduce liability at the hospital.\n\nRadiologists have usually been direct employees but it‚Äôs moving more towards group practices for specialists.\n\nUsing AI can increase capacity, but there isn‚Äôt a model where a hospital can run it, or take on the liability of doing diagnostic without human oversight.",
          "The big problem here is that AI companies, with no exception, are masters at lying with statistics. \n\nThey set up a highly artificial benchmark where it ‚Äúoutperforms‚Äù radiologists, with some enormous caveats that render it useless without a radiologist to double check it, or even useless with a radiologist."

Super Dry could also run out at izakaya pubs, which rely on draught and bottles.\n\u003E\n\u003ELawson, one of Japan‚Äôs big convenience stores, said in a statement that it stocks many Asahi Group products and ‚Äúit is possible that some of these products may become increasingly out of stock from tomorrow onwards.‚Äù\n\u003E\n\u003E‚ÄúThis is having an impact on everyone,‚Äù said an executive at another of Japan‚Äôs major retailers. ‚ÄúI think we will run out of products soon. When it comes to Super Dry, I think we‚Äôll run out in two or three days at supermarkets and Asahi‚Äôs food products within a week or so.‚Äù\n\u003E\n\u003E...\n\u003E\n\u003EThe Asahi incident follows a spate of cyber incidents at other major companies that have proved highly disruptive. Earlier this week, the UK government provided a ¬£2 billion emergency credit line to Jaguar Land Rover after production stopped for a month due to a devastating cyber attack.\n\u003E\n\u003EAccording to cyber security experts at the Tokyo-based group Nihon Cyber Defence (NCD), Japanese companies are increasingly seen as attractive targets for ransomware attackers because of their poor defenses and the fact that many companies simply paid the demanded sum through back channels.\n\u003E\n\u003EIn 2024 Japan‚Äôs National Police Agency said it had received 222 official reports of ransomware attacks‚Äîa 12 percent rise from the previous year, but experts at NCD said it represented just a small fraction of the real volume of attacks.\n\u003E\n\u003EIn a survey conducted by the agency, Japanese companies said that in 49 percent of ransomware cases, it took at least a month to recover the data lost in the attack. Asahi said in a statement that there was no confirmed leakage of customer data to external parties.\n\u003E\n\u003EIn a measure of growing public and private sector panic over cyber vulnerabilities, Japan passed a law in May that granted the government greater rights to proactively combat cyber criminals and state-sponsored hackers. The chair of the government‚Äôs policy research council at the time, Itsunori Onodera, warned that without an urgent upgrade of the nation‚Äôs cyber security, ‚Äúthe lives of Japanese people will be put at risk.‚Äù\n\nFirst, improving cyber security for all organizations across all sectors is going to be a worthwhile endeavour and should be a priority for all.

When you live in an echo chamber that technology readily serves you (the minute you click on something and engage, you'll be fed more because the algorithm deduces you must like it), you become more and more convinced that the information you're receiving is the only information, and anything else must not be real. I recently got annoyed with someone who told me covid was no longer around, and he said that he hadn't read any news about covid lately, which must mean it was gone.

Many of the participants mentioned that their media choices were responsible for the political differences that ultimately caused the relationships to end. Their stories offer fresh insights that the corrosive effects of the tendentiousness being fueled by disinformation/misinformation and partisan online communities in the public sphere can be just as divisive in private.\n\n\nThe failed relationships of people in the study ranged from committed dating relationships or cohabitations of several months or a year to marriages that ended in divorce after 23 years.
